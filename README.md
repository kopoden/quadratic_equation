<H2>The First Step</H2>

<H3>Warning!</H3>

<b><i> If you enter a letter, program will ask to repeat the input of the last coefficient.</i></b>

Firstly, you will be asked to enter the coefficients of the equation.

<b>Input format </b>:

A = ValueA <br>
B = ValueB <br>
C = ValueC <br>

A, B, C are [the rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number).

<H3>The Result</H3>

At the result the program can show you three types of messages:

1. The equation has no solutions.
2. The equation has an infinite number of solutions.
3. You will see the only solution or two roots.

<hr>

<H3>Reusing</H3>
Finally, program will ask you about one more equation.

- If you want to close program write: 0
- If you want to solve one more equation write: 1
- If you want to continue and to clear the screen, write: 2
