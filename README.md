#Quadratic Equation

This program solves [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation) and [quadratic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation).

##Short Guide

###The First Step

######Warning!

***Please, do not enter any letters and numbers(except of coefficients), which are***  
***greater than 10. In this case program will be finished immediately.***

Firstly, the program will ask you about a [degree of the equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial).  
Currently it can solves only linear and quadratic equations.  

If you have the equation of one of these types input "2" (without the quotes).  

If you have a degree, that is more than 2, program sends you a message:  

***This program can't solve so difficult equations.***

------------
###The Second Step

Then you will be asked to enter the coefficients of the equation.

**Input format:** "A B C"  

A, B, C are [the rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number).

###The Result

At the result the program can show you three types of messages:

1. The equation has no solutions.
2. The equation has an infinite number of solutions.  
3. You will see one or two roots.  

###Reusing

- If you want to close program write "0"  
- If you want to solve one more equation write "1"  
(without a quotes, of course)
