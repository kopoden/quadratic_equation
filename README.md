#Quadratic Equation

This program solves [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation) and [quadratic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation).

##Short Guide

###The First Step

######Warning!

***Please, do not enter any letters and numbers(except of coefficients), which are***  
***greater than 10. In this case program will be finished immediately.***

Firstly, the program will ask you about a [degree of the equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial).  
Currently it can solves only linear and quadratic equations.  

If you have the equation of one of these types input "2" (without the quotes).  

If the degree of equation is more than 2, program sends you a message:  
***"This program can't solve so difficult equations."***  
and suggests to enter new data.

------------
###The Second Step

Then you will be asked to enter the coefficients of the equation.

**Input format:** "A B C"  

A, B, C are [the rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number).

###The Result

At the result the program can show you three types of messages:

1. The equation has no solutions.
2. The equation has an infinite number of solutions.  
3. You will see the only solution or two roots.  

###Reusing
Finally, program will ask you about one more equation.

- If you want to close program write: 0 
- If you want to solve one more equation write: 1
- If you want to continue and to clear the screen, write: 2
